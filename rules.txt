Rules of the Counter Game:

Clicking the button costs one point.
Everyone is increasing the same click count with each click.

How you win points:

Every 10th (collective) click awards the one who clicked 5 points.
Every 100th click awards 40 points.
Every 500th click awards 250 points.

Reaching zero points means you can no longer click, but you can
just reset back to the initial 20 points.

Have fun!
